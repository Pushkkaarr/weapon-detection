#AISOLO TASK
#Assignment Overview
You are tasked with developing a computer vision system for security applications that can detect dangerous weapons in real-time surveillance footage. This system will help enhance public safety by identifying potential security threats before incidents occur.

#Target Weapons for Detection:
Your system must be capable of identifying the following weapons:
Primary Weapon Classes (Required):
Firearms - Handguns, pistols, rifles
No Weapon - Normal/safe scenarios for comparison

#Advanced Categories (Bonus Points):
 Improvised Weapons - Broken bottles, metal rods
The system should distinguish between actual weapons and similar-looking harmless objects (e.g., toy guns, kitchen utensils in appropriate contexts) to minimize false alarms in security applications.
